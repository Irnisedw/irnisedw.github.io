    <p id="school">I was born and raised in the bronx , though i did spend a year in edison, jersey when i went away to train at edison jobcorp academy back in 2013, there i took up office administration and completed with microsoft certifications. jobcorp was the only other place i lived other then my apartment back in the bronx, so i guess you can imagine it always being my dream to travel the world, i started traveling last year in 2021 i went to places like Miami , PR , Houston and Atlanta. and this year for my birthday i finally made it to canada! somewhere id had been trying to go since i was like 11 years old. I had an amazing time and Im dying to go back.</p>

  <p id="tech">
    i always been tech savvy and drawn to technology , but i always looked at it as a skill or hobby and not a career, with the covid 19 pandemic hitting the world by storm it made me realize that my whole life i had just been surviving and i decided that i wanted to start living. I wanted more , I started a business, I spent more time with my family and partner, Im traveling more . and now im taking the next step in to my tech career!
